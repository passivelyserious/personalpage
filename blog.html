            <h2>Diving Back into Technology: Raspberry Pis, AIs, and CompTIA Certifications Oh Me Oh My!</h2>
            <p class="date">December 17, 2025</p>
            <p>After graduating Summa Cum Laude from SIUE, I have been spending some free time exploring IT projects and certifications. This has been pretty fun to do, especially since I have had some raspis in my storage for over a year now.
                While none of the projects are large in scope, I have enjoyed doing passive research into what I can pull off with the equipment I have. I am a big believer in re-using old technology, so my homelab consists of a facebook marketplace
                HP Desktop, a $15 Latitude E6410 (that has a broken wifi card and failing internal battery), and 3 raspberry pis. I am fairly locked in on what I will be doing with two of them, but I am still searching for a purpose for the third. 

            </p>
            <p>I will paste some links for homelab projects below and will be sure to update this blog when able. 

            </p>
            <p>Unfortunately I must admit that AI was rather helpful in assembling this webpage. I have never been a fan of AI. I witnessed so much cheating at my university using AI tools, and I worry about AI's impact on our society. Even with 
                these negative perspectives, AI has been useful in my personal life, taking away a lot of friction for the mundane tasks. When I had annoying snags in my HTML, <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/">W3Schools</a> was my main reference
                point. When I found a snag, I cynically turned to the copilot vscode extension to see what it could offer, and my expectations were blown away. This being said, creating an ugly html and css only personal webpage is a lot simpler than debugging
                a failed prod deployment, but I am still impressed with its capabilities. A future project of mine will be to dive deep into web development standards and really make this webpage shine.
            </p>
            <p>I have obtained the CompTIA A+ in an attempt to bolster my personal resume for entry level IT jobs. This has great to refresh my knowledge after a break from the IT industry. My next task is to pass the Network+ exam in the near future. Studying 
                for this exam has proven to be a little more difficult, but it feels great knowing that I am learning new things. 
            </p>
            <p>Here are my potential projects: <a href="https://github.com/evilsocket/pwnagotchi">Pwnagotchi</a>, <a href="https://github.com/fish-net/fish-net">Fish-Net</a>, and some sort of <a href="https://www.truenas.com/truenas-community-edition/?ref=itsfoss.com">NAS</a> in the future.</p>
            <p>Thanks for reading my first blog post!
