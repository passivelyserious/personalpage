            <h2> "Frustration is the enemy of success" - Master Tom </h2>
            <p class="date"> December 19, 2025 </p>
           
            <p> When I was younger, I was enrolled in a local kickboxing studio. I was a little shy at the time, so being involved in a combat sport helped build my self-confidence. 
                The studio had a younger class that was primarily focused on fitness and confidence building. One instructor always reminded everyone that "Frustration is the enemy of success." When
                I find myself feeling frustrated, especially when troubleshooting technology, I always remember this quote.
            </p>
            <p> I have run into problem after problem setting up my Pwnagotchi. I have had the equipment to set up the Pwnagotchi for almost two years, yet the business of life always seemed to get in the 
                way. Not only did I lack time, but I always seemed to run into issues with the simple construction of the device. Thankfully, this holiday break has given me the time to push through the 
                frustration, and I am having a blast troubleshooting this technology.
            </p>
            <p> I have been able to flash the ssd, SSH into the pi zero, and configure the device via its helpful wizard. The next step is to solder the pin header to the pi zero and connect my waveshare v4 
                screen. Recent community forks of Pwnagotchi seem to have better support for different waveshare screens, so I am hopeful that I can get that aspect working. After that, I will try to get my pisugar2 
                connected to the board and powering it. I have unfortunately lost the screws to the pisugar, so I will need to swing by home depot to pick up some m2.5s. 
            </p>
            <p> Progress is being made!

            <h2>Welp</h2>
            <p class="date">December 17, 2025</p>
            <p>Absolutely SCRAPPING the first idea of a raspberry pi docker running multiple passive applications at once. That was a little silly in hindsight, but 
                lessons were learned. I will be exploring those options on my Compaq 8200 Elite Small instead. This will allow me to play with a NAS, Docker, and more intensive 
                applications (intensive being relative here). 
            </p>
            <p>I did not give up on utilizing my Raspberry Pi 3 though! I will be installing the <a href="https://www.worldcommunitygrid.org/">World Community Grid</a> on it. This is a fun way to 
                make my little pi useful while I explore other projects. Who knows, maybe I will keep it running long term. I stumbled across this project
                on a whim and find it very interesting.
            </p>
            <p> More to come soon!

            <h2>Diving Back into Technology: Raspberry Pis, AIs, and CompTIA Certifications Oh Me Oh My!</h2>
            <p class="date">December 17, 2025</p>
            <p>After graduating Summa Cum Laude from SIUE, I have been spending some free time exploring IT projects and certifications. This has been pretty fun to do, especially since I have had some raspis in my storage for over a year now.
                While none of the projects are large in scope, I have enjoyed doing passive research into what I can pull off with the equipment I have. I am a big believer in re-using old technology, so my homelab consists of a facebook marketplace
                HP Desktop, a $15 Latitude E6410 (that has a broken wifi card and failing internal battery), and 3 raspberry pis. I am fairly locked in on what I will be doing with two of them, but I am still searching for a purpose for the third. 

            </p>
            <p>I will paste some links for homelab projects below and will be sure to update this blog when able. 

            </p>
            <p>Unfortunately I must admit that AI was rather helpful in assembling this webpage. I have never been a fan of AI. I witnessed so much cheating at my university using AI tools, and I worry about AI's impact on our society. Even with 
                these negative perspectives, AI has been useful in my personal life, taking away a lot of friction for the mundane tasks. When I had annoying snags in my HTML, <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/">W3Schools</a> was my main reference
                point. When I found a snag, I cynically turned to the copilot vscode extension to see what it could offer, and my expectations were blown away. This being said, creating an ugly html and css only personal webpage is a lot simpler than debugging
                a failed prod deployment, but I am still impressed with its capabilities. A future project of mine will be to dive deep into web development standards and really make this webpage shine.
            </p>
            <p>I have obtained the CompTIA A+ in an attempt to bolster my personal resume for entry level IT jobs. This has great to refresh my knowledge after a break from the IT industry. My next task is to pass the Network+ exam in the near future. Studying 
                for this exam has proven to be a little more difficult, but it feels great knowing that I am learning new things. 
            </p>
            <p>Here are my potential projects: <a href="https://github.com/evilsocket/pwnagotchi">Pwnagotchi</a>, <a href="https://github.com/fish-net/fish-net">Fish-Net</a>, and some sort of <a href="https://www.truenas.com/truenas-community-edition/?ref=itsfoss.com">NAS</a> in the future.</p>
            <p>Thanks for reading my first blog post!
